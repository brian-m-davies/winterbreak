<h1>Instructions</h1>

<p>If you've never played a text adventure game before, it might look a little daunting.  You're staring at a blinking cursor and you don't know what to do.</p>

<p>The short answer is: type commands in English.  The game has a small but robust vocabulary, and it does a pretty good job of understanding basic short sentences.</p>


<h2>Navigating</h2>

<p>You can get around by typing <b>GO</b> and then a direction -- <b>GO NORTH</b> or <b>GO SOUTHEAST</b> (or just <b>N</b> or <b>SE</b> for short).  That works for any of the 8 compass points.  You can also <b>GO UP</b> or <b>GO DOWN</b> (again, <b>U</b> and <b>D</b> for short).</p>

<p>Once you get somewhere, you can <b>LOOK</b> (shortcut: <b>L</b>) to see where you are.  Usually the room description will tell you where you can go from there.</p>

	
<h2>Objects</h2>

<p>The world is full of objects.  When you find an object, you can interact with it an a number of ways.</p>

<ul>
<li>To learn more about any object, you can <b>LOOK AT it</b> or <b>EXAMINE it</b> (<b>X</b> for short).</li>
<li>Many objects are portable, in which case you can <b>TAKE it</b> or <b>GET it</b> or <b>PICK it UP</b>, and then you can <b>DROP it</b>.  You can do this with multiple objects at once, if you <b>TAKE it AND something else</b> or even <b>TAKE EVERYTHING</b> or <b>DROP ALL</b>.</li>
<li>If it is a container, like your trunk, or a door, you can <b>OPEN it</b> and <b>CLOSE it</b>.  Containers hold objects, so you can <b>PUT object IN it</b>.  And some doors and containers take a key, so you can <b>LOCK it WITH something</b> or <b>UNLOCK it WITH something</b>.</li>
<li>If it has a surface, you can <b>PUT object ON it</b>  If the surface is large enough, you can even <b>SIT ON it</b> or <b>LIE ON it</b> or <b>STAND ON it</b>.</li>
<li>If it is clothing, like your house robes, you can <b>WEAR it</b> / <b>PUT it ON</b> / <b>REMOVE it</b> / <b>TAKE it OFF</b></li>
<li>If it is food, like a pot pie, you can <b>EAT it</b>.</li>
<li>If it is a liquid, you can often <b>DRINK it</b>.  Liquids can also be moved around by <b>FILL container WITH liquid</b> or <b>PUT container IN liquid</b> to fill it, and <b>POUR liquid ON object</b> to empty it.</li>
<li>If it is a book, you can <b>READ book</b>, or <b>CONSULT book ABOUT topic</b> or <b>READ ABOUT topic IN book</b> if you want to look for something specific.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you've picked up objects, you can see what you're holding with <b>INVENTORY</b> (<b>I</b> for short).</p>


<h2>People</h2>

<p>People in text adventures tend to be a little thin.  If you meet a person, these should work:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>ASK person ABOUT something</b></li>
<li><b>ASK person FOR something</b></li>
<li><b>GIVE something TO person</b></li>
</ul>


<h2>General</h2>

<p>There are a few other commands that will usually work:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>WAIT</b> (<b>Z</b> for short)</li>
<li><b>AGAIN</b> (<b>G</b> for short)</li>
<li><b>SLEEP</b></li>
<li><b>UNDO</b></li>
<li><b>SCORE</b></li>
</ul>

<p>And then, so that you don't have to play the entire game in one sitting, you can <b>SAVE</b> to save your game at any time, and then <b>RESTORE</b> to resume your game later.</p>
