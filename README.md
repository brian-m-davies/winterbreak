# Winter Break At Hogwarts

This is a parser-based piece of interactive fiction, set in the universe of Harry Potter.  It was modeled after the great Infocom games of yore, with a large, open-ended world to explore, and dozens of puzzles on the way to solving the mystery.  It comes complete with feelies (a five-level map) and a hint file in the spirit of the old Invisiclues.  It was built using Inform 7.

You can play it [directly over the web](https://brian-m-davies.github.io/winterbreak/) with no installation.

It finished in the money at IFComp 2019, exactly 41 of 82.  I'm grateful it did as well as it did, given that it's a terrible fit for IFComp.  (The competition rules say judges should rate a game after 2 hours -- this game, like the old Infocom games which were $50 each, is intended to take 10-20 hours to complete.)  It had the 12th highest standard deviation, meaning a definite "love it or hate it" game.

This release (March 2021) is a major revision of the IFComp version, based on extensive playtesting from Greg Frost.  The old version is available [here](https://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=p3ll441r7a5r12yh) but the one here on Github should be considered the preferred version.
