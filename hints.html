<h1>Hints</h1>

<p>Below are hints for all the puzzles in the game.  Click a topic to see the next hint...</p>

<p>A couple of general hints:</p>

<p>Save your game.  Do it before heading into the unknown.  Do it before eating things.  The game is fairly forgiving, but you can get poisoned, you can drown, you can get locked out of places, you can destroy items that are hard to replace, and of course, you can be killed by your nemesis.</p>

<p>You will never die of hunger or cold or sleep deprivation, but they are there to make life feel more realistic.  There is magically regenerating food in the great hall, enough to last several days.  There is a spare overcoat in the Entrance Hall.  Neither are necessary, but they will reduce the amount of whinging.</p>
